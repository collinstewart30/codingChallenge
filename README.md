# codingChallenge
A coding coin challenge to find how many ways you can get change with a number of currencies. Ex: if you have a quarter, dime, nickel and penny how many different ways are there to get $1?

To run:

1. Download the zip file.

2. Once the file is downloaded, unzip it.

3. When the file is unzipped, open up an IDE in order to open the project. The suggested IDE is Intellij Community Version (free) but other Java IDE's will work as well.

4. Once you have the project open in your preferred IDE, open the file in the location "CodingChallenege -> src -> codingChallenge.java"

5. Once you have the file open, you can see the code and you can build and run the project to see the results.
